All:
Delete all directional lights from your scene and add the "SKYPRO" prefab to your scene.

Sky:
To use the sky shader, open the lighting panel and assign either the premade material "SKYPRO_Sky" 
in Sky/Materials or a custom material using the same shader to the skybox material slot.

Fog:
To use the fog is requires some more setup than the sky. To use it, select your
URP Forward Renderer asset, enable Opaque Texture and Depth Texture and set the
opaque downsizing to none. Next, open your forward renderer and select add
renderer feature. Select "SKYPRO_Renderer". Open the settings and assign the premade 
fog material in SKYPRO/Materials or create your own using the "Shadergraphs/Fog" shader.

Clouds:
Setup is the same as the fog except use the clouds material instead of the fog.
